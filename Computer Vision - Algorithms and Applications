Chapter 1. Introduction

In formulating and solving computer vision problems, I have often found it useful to draw
inspiration from three high-level approaches:
• Scientific: build detailed models of the image formation process and develop mathematical
techniques to invert these in order to recover the quantities of interest (where
necessary, making simplifying assumption to make the mathematics more tractable).
• Statistical: use probabilistic models to quantify the prior likelihood of your unknowns
and the noisy measurement processes that produce the input images, then infer the best
possible estimates of your desired quantities and analyze their resulting uncertainties.
The inference algorithms used are often closely related to the optimization techniques
used to invert the (scientific) image formation processes.
• Engineering: develop techniques that are simple to describe and implement but that
are also known to work well in practice. Test these techniques to understand their
limitation and failure modes, as well as their expected computational costs (run-time
performance).

it is better to think back from the problem at hand to suitable techniques, rather
than to grab the first technique that you may have heard of.
